## **About me**

I'm 30 years old. Having started his career, I had to try myself in various fields of activity, where often no intellectual development was expected.
My goal is to make my life better and more interesting. I want to grow, develop my skills and make new acquaintances. For this reason, I chose Front-End development.
I've been studying web development for about 2 years. Several Front-End Developer courses have been completed and several trial projects have been completed.
My dedication and sociability will help me grow and develop in my chosen profession.

## **My skills**
Basic knowledge:
* HTML, CSS 
* JavaScript
